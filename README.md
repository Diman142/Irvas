# Irvas
Landing page for Irvas company.  I used native JS for interactivity and tryed to use module structure of code

I used next stack
HTML, CSS, JS, GULP, JQ

For start site from IDE you can use gulp default task

If you want to open the site manually in the browser (using index.js) use index.js from dist directory.
